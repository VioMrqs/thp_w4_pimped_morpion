In this project, we're creating a little tic-tac-toe program. 

It takes the name of two players. The starting player is determined randomly.

At each turn, it registers the decision of each player and transcribes in onto the board. 

The game ends on a victory or a draw. The program then asks if the players want to start another game and only stops if they don't. 

To continue :
- erase & replace values when choising a value someone choose
- Class User : should include symbol
- could pimp it a little
